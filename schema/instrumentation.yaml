      stability_opt_in_list:

        description: |
          Configure semantic convention stability opt-in as a comma-separated list.
          This property follows the format and semantics of the OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN environment variable.
          Controls the emission of stable vs. experimental semantic conventions for instrumentation.
          This setting is only intended for migrating from experimental to stable semantic conventions.

          Known values include:
          - http: Emit stable HTTP and networking conventions only
          - http/dup: Emit both old and stable HTTP and networking conventions (for phased migration)
          - database: Emit stable database conventions only
          - database/dup: Emit both old and stable database conventions (for phased migration)
          - rpc: Emit stable RPC conventions only
          - rpc/dup: Emit both experimental and stable RPC conventions (for phased migration)
          - messaging: Emit stable messaging conventions only
          - messaging/dup: Emit both old and stable messaging conventions (for phased migration)

          Multiple values can be specified as a comma-separated list (e.g., "http,database/dup").
          Additional signal types (e.g., messaging) may be supported in future versions.

          Domain-specific semconv properties (e.g., .instrumentation/development.general.http.semconv) take precedence over this general setting.
