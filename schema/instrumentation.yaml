          Configure semantic convention stability opt-in.
          Controls the emission of stable vs. experimental semantic conventions for instrumentation.
          This setting is only intended for migrating from experimental to stable semantic conventions.

          Known values include:
          - http: Emit stable HTTP and networking conventions only
          - http/dup: Emit both old and stable HTTP and networking conventions (for phased migration)
          - database: Emit stable database conventions only
          - database/dup: Emit both old and stable database conventions (for phased migration)
          - rpc: Emit stable RPC conventions only
          - rpc/dup: Emit both experimental and stable RPC conventions (for phased migration)

          Additional signal types (e.g., messaging) may be supported in future versions.

          See:
          - HTTP migration: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/http-migration/
          - Database migration: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/database/
