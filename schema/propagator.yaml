      Configure the propagators in the composite text map propagator. Entries from .composite_list are appended to the list here with duplicates filtered out.
      Built-in propagator keys include: tracecontext, baggage, b3, b3multi, jaeger, ottrace. Known third party keys include: xray. 
      If the resolved list of propagators (from .composite and .composite_list) is empty, a noop propagator is used.
