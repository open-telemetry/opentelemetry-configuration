# Overview <a id="overview"></a>


This document is an auto-generated view of the declarative configuration JSON schema and meta schema meant for improved consumability by humans.

* [Types](#types) contains descriptions of all types and properties, with convenient linking between type references. [OpenTelemetryConfiguration](#opentelemetryconfiguration) is the root type and is a good starting point.
* [Experimental Types](#experimental-types) same as [Types](#types) but for experimental types subject to breaking changes.
* [Language Support Status](#language-support-status) provides all the details about each language's support in a single place. (Alternatively, each type definition has a table showing support status across languages.)
* [SDK Extension Plugins](#sdk-extension-plugins) lists all the SDK extension plugin points.

# SDK Extension Plugins <a id="sdk-extension-plugins"></a>

[SDK extension plugins](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/configuration/sdk.md#supported-sdk-extension-plugins) are places where custom interface implementations can be referenced and configured.

For example, you could write a custom `SpanExporter`, and indicate that it should be paired with a `BatchSpanProcessor`.

Each of the following types support referencing custom interface implementations. Each type is an object type containing exactly one property whose value is type `object` or `null`. The property key refers to the name of the custom implementation, and must be the same as the `name` of a corresponding registered [ComponentProvider](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/configuration/sdk.md#register-componentprovider). The value passed as configuration when the [ComponentProvider.create](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/configuration/sdk.md#create) is called.

SDK extension plugin types may have properties defined corresponding to built-in implementations of the interface. For example, the `otlp_http` property of `SpanExporter` defines the OTLP http/protobuf exporter.
