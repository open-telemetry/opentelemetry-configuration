# JSON Schema Definitions for OpenTelemetry File Configuration

[![Build Check](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-configuration/actions/workflows/build-check.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-configuration/actions/workflows/build-check.yaml)

This repository contains the JSON schema that defines the OpenTelemetry configuration. This schema can be utilized to generate model code for implementations and to validate the structure of a configuration file. The repository comes as a result of [OTEP #225](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/976c9395e4cbb3ea933d3b51589eba94b87a17bd/text/0225-configuration.md), where JSON schema was chosen for the following reasons:

- support for client-side validation
- code generation
- broad support across languages

## Code generation

There are [several tools](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html) available to generate code from a JSON schema. The following shows an example for generating code from the JSON schema in Go:

```bash
go-jsonschema \
    -p telemetry \
    --schema-package=https://opentelemetry.io/otelconfig/opentelemetry_configuration.json=github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/schema \
    ./schema/opentelemetry_configuration.json
```

## Stability definition

Before reaching 1.0, each minor version change is equivalent to major version change. That is, there are no guarantees about compatibility and all changes are permitted. As of 1.0, we provide the following stability guarantees:

- For major version: No guarantees.
- For minor versions: TBD

Allowable changes:

- For major versions: All changes are permitted.
- For minor versions: TBD

## Naming guidelines

The following defines guidelines used to produce configuration schema:

1. To remove redundant information from the configuration file, prefixes for data produced by each of the providers
will removed from configuration options. For example, under the `meter_provider` configuration, metric readers will be
identified by the word `readers` rather than by `metric_readers`. Similarly, the prefix `span_` will be dropped for tracer
provider configuration, and `logrecord` for logger provider.
