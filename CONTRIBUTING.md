## Schema modeling rules

The following rules are enforced when modeling the configuration schema. 

These rules must be enforced when making changes to the schema; however, changes to the rules are permitted. In other words, the [stability definition](./README.md#stability-definition) does not apply to the rules: so long as the stability definition is not violated for existing properties, the modeling rules guiding new properties may change.

### Which JSON schema version?

The schema is modeled using JSON schema [draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12).

This is reflected in top level schema documents by setting `"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`.

### What properties are part of schema?

Only properties which are described in [opentelemetry-specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification) or [semantic-conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions) are modeled in the schema. However, it's acceptable to allow additional properties specific to a particular language or implementation, and not covered by the schema. Model these by setting `"additionalProperties": true` (see [JSON schema additionalProperties](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#additionalproperties)). Types should set `"additionalProperties": false` by default unless requested by an opentelemetry component [maintainer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#maintainer) which supports additional options.

### Property naming

To remove redundant information from the configuration file, prefixes for data produced by each of the providers will be removed from configuration options. For example, under the `meter_provider` configuration, metric readers are identified by the word `readers` rather than by `metric_readers`. Similarly, the prefix `span_` will be dropped for tracer provider configuration, and `logrecord` for logger provider.

### Property name case

Properties defined in the schema should be lower [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

### Properties which pattern matching

When a property requires pattern matching, use wildcard `*` (match any number of any character, including none) and `?` (match any single character) instead of regex. If a single property with wildcards is likely to be insufficient to model the configuration requirements, accept `included` and `excluded` properties, each with an array of strings with wildcard entries. The wildcard entries should be joined with a logical OR. If `included` is not specified, assume that all entries are included. Apply `excluded` after applying `included`. Examples:

* Given `excluded: ["a*"]`: Match all except values starting with `a`.
* Given `included: ["a*", "b*"]`, `excluded: ["ab*"]`: Match any value starting with `a` or `b`, excluding values starting with `ab`.
* Given `included: ["a", "b"]`, `excluded: ["a"]`: Match values equal to `b`.

### Data modeling and environment variable substitution

Properties should be modeled using the most appropriate data structures and types to represent the information. This may result in a schema which doesn't support env var substitution for the [standard env vars](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/configuration/sdk-environment-variables.md) where a type mismatch occurs. For example, the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` env var is modeled as a string, consisting of a comma separated list of key-value pairs, which is not the natural way to model a mapping of key-value pairs in JSON schema.

In instances where there is a type mismatch between the JSON schema and equivalent standard env var, an alternative version of the property may be provided to resolve the mismatch. For example, resource attributes are configured at `.resource.attributes`, but `.resource.attributes_list` is available with a format matching that of `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`. Alternative properties are reserved for cases where there is a demonstrated need for platforms to be able to participate in configuration and there is no reasonable alternative.

### Name-value pairs

When a type requires a configurable list of name-value pairs (i.e. resource attributes, HTTP headers), model using an array of objects, each with `name` and `value` properties. While an array of name-value objects is slightly more verbose than an object where each key-value is an entry, the latter is preferred because:

* Avoids user input as keys, which ensures conformity with the [snake_case properties](#property-name-case) rule.
* Allows both the names and the values to be targets for [env var substitution]. For example:

    ```yaml
   tracer_provider:
     processors:
       - batch:
           exporter:
             otlp:
               headers:
                - name: ${AUTHORIZATION_HEADER_NAME:-api-key}
                  value: ${AUTHORIZATION_HEADER_VALUE}
    ```

### Required and null properties

JSON schema has two related but subtly different concepts involved in indicating the requirement level of properties and values:

* [`type` of `null`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/null): When a property includes a type of `null` along with other allowed types (i.e. `"type": ["string", "null"]`), it indicates that even if the property key is present, the value may be omitted. This is useful in a variety of situations:
  * When modeling properties with primitive types which are candidates for [env var substitution][], since allowing `null` means that the configuration is valid even if the referenced env var is undefined.
  * When modeling objects which do not require any properties. In these cases, either no properties are required, or there are no properties and the presence of the property key expresses the desired state.
* [required](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#required): When a property is `required`, the key must be included in the object or the configuration is invalid. Properties should be required when there is no well default semantic (i.e. it's not clear what the behavior is when the property is absent).

For example:

```
tracer_provider:
 processors:
   - simple:
       exporter:
         console:
 limits:
   attribute_value_length_limit: ${OTEL_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT}
```

* `tracer_provider` is not required. When omitted, a noop tracer provider is used.
* `tracer_provider`'s type is `object`. There's no sensible tracer provider which does not minimally set one entry in `processors`.
* `exporter` is required. A simple processor without an exporter is invalid.
* `exporter`'s type is `object`. Setting `exporter` to `null` or any non-object value is invalid.
* `console`'s type is `["object", "null"]`. The console exporter has no properties, and we should not force the user to set an empty object (i.e `console: {}`).
* `limits` is not required. When omitted, default span limits are used.
* `limits`'s type is `object`. If a user includes the `limits` property, they must set at least one property. Settings `limits` to `null` is invalid.
* `attributes_value_length_limit` is not required. If omitted, no attribute length limits are applied.
* `attributes_value_length_limit`'s type is `["integer", "null]`. If null (i.e. because the `OTEL_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT` env var is unset), no attribute length limits are applied.

If a property is _not_ required, it must include `defaultBehavior` in the [meta schema](#meta_schema_typesyaml) describing the semantics when it is omitted.

If a property is required and `type` includes `null`, it must include `nullBehavior` in the [meta schema](#meta_schema_typesyaml) describing the semantics when it is null.

Optionally, a property which is _not_ required and `type` includes `null` may specify `nullBehavior` to differentiate between cases where it is `null` and omitted.

### Polymorphic types

JSON schema's [schema composition](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining) keywords (`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`) offer a tempting mechanism for object-oriented style inheritance and polymorphic patterns. However, JSON schema code generation tools may struggle or not support these keywords. Therefore, these keywords should be used judiciously, and should not be used to extend `object` types.

For example:

```json
{
  "Shape": {
    "title": "Shape",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "sides": { "type": "integer"}
    }
  },
  "Square": {
    "title": "Square",
    "type": "object",
    "allOf": [{"$ref": "#/$defs/Shape"}],
    "properties": {
      "side_length": {"type": "integer"}
    }
  }
}
```

`allOf` is used in the `Square` type to extend the parent `Shape` type, such that `Square` has properties `sides` and `side_length`. Avoid this type of use.

Another example:

```json
{
  "AttributeNameValue": {
    "title": "AttributeNameValue",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "value": {
        "oneOf": [
          {"type": "string"},
          {"type": "number"},
          {"type": "boolean"},
          {"type": "null"},
          {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
          {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "boolean"}},
          {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "number"}}
        ]
      },
      "type": {
        "$ref": "#/$defs/AttributeType"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "name", "value"
    ]
  },
  "AttributeType": {
    "type": ["string", "null"],
    "enum": [
      null,
      "string",
      "bool",
      "int",
      "double",
      "string_array",
      "bool_array",
      "int_array",
      "double_array"
    ]
  }
}
```

`oneOf` is used to specify that the `value` property matches the [Attribute AnyValue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/common/README.md#anyvalue) definition, and is either a primitive or array of primitives. This type of use is acceptable but should be used judiciously.

### Annotations - title and description

The JSON schema [`title` and `description` annotations](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/annotations) are keywords which are not involved in validation. Instead, they act as a mechanism to help schemas be self-documenting, and may be used by code generation tools.

Despite these potential benefits, these keywords should be omitted:

* The titles of `object` and `enum` types produced by code generation tools should be defined using key values in [$defs](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring#defs). Setting the `title` keyword introduces multiple sources of truth and possible conflict.
* As described in [description generation](./CONTRIBUTING.md#make-generate-descriptions), we use a different mechanism to describe the semantics of types and properties. Setting the `description` keyword introduces multiple sources of truth and possible conflict.

## Schemas and subschemas

In JSON Schema, a [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) is a document, and a [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) is contained in surrounding parent schema. Subschemas can be nested in various ways:

A property can directly describe a complex set of requirements including nested structures:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "shape": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "color": { "type": "string" },
        "sides": { "type": "int" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or a property can reference a subschema residing in a schema document's [$defs](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring#defs):

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "shape": {
      "$ref": "#/$defs/Shape"
    }
  },
  "$defs": {
    "Shape": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "color": { "type": "string" },
        "sides": { "type": "int" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In order to promote stylistic consistency and allow for reuse of concepts, `object` and `enum` types should be defined in either as a top level schema document or as a subschema in a schema document's `$defs`.

## Consistency Checks

This repository has various checks to ensure the schema changes are valid. Before using:

- Install the latest LTS release of **[Node](https://nodejs.org/)**.
  For example, using **[nvm][]** under Linux run:

  ```bash
  nvm install --lts
  ```

- Install tooling packages:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

You can perform all checks locally using this command:

```bash
make all
```

## Meta schema

[meta_schema_*.yaml](schema) files track schema details that don't fit neatly into the JSON schema including:

* Property descriptions and semantics
* Track which types are SDK extension plugins
* Implementation support status

The meta schema is broken across multiple files for improved maintainability:

* [meta_schema_types.yaml](#meta_schema_typesyaml)
* [meta_schema_language_{language}.yaml](#meta_schema_language_languageyaml)

There are a variety of build tasks which intersect with the meta schema:

* [make fix-meta-schema](#make-fix-meta-schema)
* [make generate-markdown](#make-generate-markdown)
* [make generate-descriptions](#make-generate-descriptions)
* [make all-meta-schema](#make-all-meta-schema)

### `meta_schema_types.yaml`

[meta_schema_types.yaml](schema/meta_schema_types.yaml) contains property descriptions, semantics, and SDK extension plugin information.

Content looks like:

```yaml
- type: SpanExporter
  properties:
    - property: otlp_http
      description: Configure exporter to be OTLP with HTTP transport.
      defaultBehavior: OTLP HTTP exporter is not used
      nullBehavior: OTLP HTTP exporter is used with defaults
# other types omitted for brevity
```

Notes:

* `[]` the document is an array of entries for each type in the JSON schema.
  * `[].type` is the name of the JSON schema type. **Maintained automatically by build tooling.**
  * `[].properties` is an array of entries for each property in the JSON schema type.
    * `[].properties[].property` the name of the property. **Maintained automatically by build tooling.**
    * `[].properties[].description` the property description, including semantics and default behavior.
    * `[].properties[].defaultBehavior` the behavior if the property is omitted. Required if the property is not `required`. Must not be present if property is `required`.
    * `[].properties[].nullBehavior` the behavior if the property is present and null. Required if the property is `required` and may be `null`. Optional to override `defaultBehavior` if the property is not `required`. 

### `meta_schema_language_{language}.yaml`

These files track language implementation status for a particular language. See [fix-meta-schema](#make-fix-meta-schema) for details on adding a new language.

Content looks like:

```yaml
latestSupportedFileFormat: 1.0.0-rc.1
typeSupportStatuses:
  - type: Base2ExponentialBucketHistogramAggregation
    status: supported # the support status, see below for allowed enum values
    notes: ""
    propertyOverrides:
      - property: record_min_max
        status: ignored
  # other types omitted for brevity
 ```

Notes:

* `.latestSupportedFileFormat` is the latest version of `opentelemetry-configuration` supported by the `{language}`
* `.typeSupportStatuses` is an array with entries for each type in the JSON schema.
  * `.typeSupportStatuses[].type` is the name of the JSON schema type. **Maintained automatically by build tooling.**
  * `.typeSupportStatuses[].status` captures the support status of the type and all properties except overrides in `.typeSupportStatuses[].propertyOverrides`. See enum options below.
  * `.typeSupportStatuses[].propertyOverrides` an array of properties which have different support statuses than the overall type as recorded in `.typeSupportStatuses[].status.
    * `.typeSupportStatuses[].propertyOverrides[].property` the name of the property whose support status is overridden.
    * `.typeSupportStatuses[].propertyOverrides[].status` the overridden support status. See enum options below.
* Status enum options, applicable to `.typeSupportStatuses[].status`, `.typeSupportStatuses[].propertyOverrides[].status`:
  * `unknown`: Language maintainer has not yet recorded a status.
  * `suppported`: The type / property is supported by the language implementation.
  * `not_implemented`: The type / property is not parsed / recognized by the language implementation because the concept is not yet implemented but should be eventually.
  * `not_applicable`: The type / property is not parsed / recognized by the language implementation because the concept is not applicable. E.g. C++ specific instrumentation for Java. 
  * `ignored`: The type / property is not parsed / recognized by the language implementation despite the concept being available in the language's programmatic configuration API.

### `make fix-meta-schema`

Ensures that the JSON schema and the meta schema are kept in sync:

* If a type exists in the JSON schema and not the meta schema, add it.
* If a type exists in the meta schema and not the JSON schema, delete it.
* For each meta schema type:
  * If a property exists in the JSON schema and not the meta schema, add it.
  * If a property exists in the meta schema and not the JSON schema, delete it.
  * If a property is required in the JSON schema and has defaultBehavior in the meta schema, delete it. If a property is not required in the JSON schema and does not have defaultBehavior in the meta schema, add it.
  * If a property is required and nullable in the JSON schema and does not have nullBehavior in the meta schema, add it.
* If a language implementation is known (i.e. defined in constant array `KNOWN_LANGUAGES` in [meta-schema.js](./scripts/meta-schema.js)) but not in meta schema, add it.
* If a language implementation exists in meta schema but is not known, delete it.
* For each language implementation:
  * If a type exists in the JSON schema and not in the language implementation's type support status of the meta schema, add it.
  * If a type exists in the language implementation's type support status of the meta schema and no in the JSON schema, delete it.
  * For each property in a type's propertyOverrides:
    * If the property does not exist in the JSON schema, delete it.

When this task adds new entries to the meta schema, they are stubbed out with `TODO` placeholders. Contributors should update these with sensible values.

**NOTE:** This task is run as part of build automation. If it produces changes which are not checked into version control, the build will fail.

### `make generate-markdown`

Generates markdown at [schema-docs.md](./schema-docs.md) which summarizes a variety of useful information about JSON schema and meta schema in an easy to consume format.

**NOTE:** This task is run as part of build automation. If it produces changes which are not checked into version control, the build will fail.

### `make generate-descriptions`

Annotates files in [./examples](./examples) with comments derived from the JSON schema and meta schema.

The `/examples` directory contains a variety of examples which are expected to be used as starter templates and as references. The JSON schema is insufficient in describing the expected behavior of a given config file. It's missing key details describing behavior semantics (such as defaults) which are essential for both users and implementers. This task ensures that all examples are correctly and consistently commented.

**NOTE:** This task is run as part of build automation. If it produces changes which are not checked into version control, the build will fail.

To run against a single file:

- Install the latest LTS release of **[Node](https://nodejs.org/)**.
  For example, using **[nvm][]** under Linux run:

  ```bash
  nvm install --lts
  ```

- Install tooling packages:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Run the script:

```shell
npm run-script generate-descriptions -- /absolute/path/to/input/file.yaml /absolute/path/to/output/file.yaml
```

Optionally, include the `--debug` parameter. This prints out information about
each key value pair, including the computed dot notation location, the matched
rule, the previous description, the new description, etc.

```shell
npm run-script generate-descriptions -- /absolute/path/to/input/file.yaml /absolute/path/to/output/file.yaml --debug
```

### `make all-meta-schema`

A composite task which runs all meta schema tasks.
