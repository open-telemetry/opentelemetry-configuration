# kitchen-sink.yaml demonstrates all configurable surface area.
#
# It DOES NOT represent expected real world configuration, as it makes strange configuration
# choices in an effort to exercise the full surface area.
#
# Configuration values are set to their defaults when default values are defined.
#
# For schema documentation, including required properties, semantics, default behavior, etc,
# see: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-configuration/blob/main/schema-docs.md
