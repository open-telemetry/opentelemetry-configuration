# sdk-config.yaml is a good starting point for configuring the SDK, including exporting to
# localhost via OTLP.
#
# NOTE: With the exception of env var substitution syntax (i.e. ${MY_ENV}), SDKs ignore
# environment variables when interpreting config files. This including ignoring all env
# vars defined in https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/.
